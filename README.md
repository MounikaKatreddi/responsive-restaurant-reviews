# Restaurant Reviews

---

## Project Purpose:

This project is part of the **[Udacity Front End Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)**. The goal is to transform a static site that lacks accessibility into a fully responsive site that accessible for screen reader use. The site also a service worker to cache assets for offline use.

The map is generated by the Google Maps API. The list of restaurants is generated by a call to a database provided for the project.

## Loading instructions

This app must be loaded using a localhost server. If you have Python 2.x installed you can run the Python Simple Server like this.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

For Python 3.x, the command is:

```
-m http.server 8080
```

Or if you prefer you can use Node [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). If you do not have it installed you can install it with:

```
npm install -g serve
```

and then navigate into the build directory and run

```
serve -p 8080
```

In either case navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Changing the server portion

This app is set up to serve data from port 8080. If you have a conflict on your machine you can change the listening port in the `dbhelper.js` file:

```
static get DATABASE_URL() {
  const port = 8080;  // <-- change to your preferred port
  return `http://localhost:${port}/data/restaurants.json`;
}
```

## How to Use the App

* The app will load displaying a map of New York with markers for each restaurant and a list of restaurants
